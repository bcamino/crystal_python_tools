    "This notebook allows you to generate the surface projected bulk band structure (spbs) of any material. The theory of spbs can be found in the <a href='https://doi.org/10.25560/45464'>Appendix 1 of Bruno Camino's PhD Thesis</a>.\n",
    "Steps to generate the spbs:\n",
    "- run a bulk calculation with the ROTATE keyword (please see ../data/spbs/si.d12 for an example). The ROTATE option, followed by the Miller indeces of the desired surface, rotates the primitive cell in order to have two lattice vectors on the plane specified\n",
    "- in the cell below specify the k point path containing high symmetry k points for the surface\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will generate the inputs to scan along the direction $\\perp$ to the surface. If run\n",
    "- Write the inputs in terms of shrinking factor\n",
    "- Scan along the direction $\\perp$ to the surface\n",
    "- Plot the bands and shade the area between bands\n",
